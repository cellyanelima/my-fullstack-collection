## ðŸ“š **Fullstack Collection App**

### **Project Description**  
The **Fullstack Collection App** is a fullstack application designed to manage a custom collection of items (e.g., books, movies, or any other data). This project demonstrates the integration of a **React frontend**, a **Node.js/Express backend**, and a **database** using Knex for migrations and seeding. The application uses **React Query** for efficient data fetching and state management.  

**Technologies and Tools Used:**  
- **Front-end:** React.js  
- **Back-end:** Node.js with Express  
- **Database:** SQLite3 with Knex.js (migrations and seed data)  
- **Data Fetching:** React Query (useQuery and useMutation hooks)  
- **API Testing:** Thunder Client  
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub  
- **Package Management:** npm  
- **Development Environment:** dotenv for environment variables

### **Motivations**  
This project was created to:  
1. **Practice Fullstack Development:** Build a fully functional fullstack application that combines database management, API development, and a dynamic React frontend.  
2. **Explore React Query:** Gain hands-on experience using `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks for efficient data fetching, caching, and mutations.  
3. **Develop CRUD Operations:** Implement **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** functionalities to manage data seamlessly.  
4. **Database Design:** Learn to design simple yet effective database schemas and use Knex.js for migrations and seed data.  

The idea of tracking collections (like books, movies, or other items) provided a simple and practical problem to solve, allowing focus on building robust and reusable components while exploring fullstack capabilities.

### **What I Learned**  
Working on this project taught me valuable lessons, including:  
- **Backend API Development:** Setting up a **Node.js/Express** server, creating routes, and connecting it to a database using **Knex.js**.  
- **React Query:** Efficiently fetching, caching, and mutating data with the `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks, simplifying state management and improving performance.  
- **Database Management:** Designing a simple database schema, writing migrations, and populating seed data to simulate real-world datasets.  
- **Error Handling:** Implementing error handling in API calls and React components to improve application stability.  
- **Separation of Concerns:** Structuring the project with clear separation between the database, API routes, and React components.
